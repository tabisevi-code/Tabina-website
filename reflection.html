    <article class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 820px;">
      <p class="lh-lg">In 2020, when most of life moved online, a friend told me she had lost her scholarship and was terrified about what came next. She said she might become depressed. I tried to comfort her—but I also said something I still regret: <strong>“I don’t think depression is real.”</strong></p>

      <p class="lh-lg">I wasn’t super happy growing up; I had my own rough phases. But I didn’t understand how depression could take hold—how it could make basic things hard, or make someone feel like they were losing themselves.</p>

      <p class="lh-lg">Later, as an adult, I faced situations that scared me. I started thinking, “I hope I don’t get depressed from this.” That’s when I realized: it isn’t about being strong or weak. Sometimes the feelings aren’t in your control. I was afraid of losing myself to them—and that fear taught me how real depression is.</p>

      <blockquote class="blockquote border-start ps-3 my-4">
        <p class="mb-0">Depression is real. Stigma is harmful. Empathy is a choice we can make every day.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 class="h4 mt-5">What I wish I’d said instead</h2>
      <ul class="lh-lg">
        <li>“I’m here for you. Want to talk?”</li>
        <li>“I don’t know exactly what you’re going through, but I’ll listen.”</li>
        <li>“It’s okay to ask for help.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="h4 mt-5">Why I built this site</h2>
      <p class="lh-lg">Because stigma keeps people quiet and alone. Because the words we choose matter. Because I want to be someone who helps others feel safe to speak and seek support.</p>

        <p class="mb-0 small text-muted">If you’re struggling, consider reaching out to someone you trust or a mental health professional in your area. You deserve care.</p>
