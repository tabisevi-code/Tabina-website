Mental Health Matters — Breaking the Stigma

Access:  
- https://tabisevi-code.github.io/Tabina-website/index.html

Overview & Audience
So this website is basically about the stigma around mental health. This was inspired by something i said years ago that I regret — I used to think depression wasn’t real until I went through stuff myself. It’s me reflecting on that and talking about how people (for example younger me) don’t really understand how serious it can be. This site is for anyone who’s ever been told to “just get over it” or who wants to actually understand what others go through.

- Home (`index.html`) — contains: theme statement, hero, story summary, CTA
