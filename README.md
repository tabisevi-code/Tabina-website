**Access:**  
- https://tabisevi-code.github.io/Tabina-website/index.html

## Overview & Audience
This site explores the stigma around mental health through a personal story and a short, readable guide. The audience is students and young adults who may not know how to talk about depression and want language that supports rather than stigmatizes.

## Site Map
- **Home (`index.html`)** — Theme statement, hero, story summary, CTA
- **Understanding (`stigma.html`)** — What stigma is, how it harms, better language, what helps
- **Reflection (`reflection.html`)** — Full personal narrative and takeaways

## Design Notes
- **Framework:** Bootstrap 5 via CDN for consistent, responsive layout.
- **Style:** Calming blue accent, serif headings for emphasis, sans-serif body for readability.
- **Structure:** Clear sections with hierarchy; consistent navbar and footer across pages.
- **Accessibility:** Meaningful `alt` text on images; readable contrast; simple language.
